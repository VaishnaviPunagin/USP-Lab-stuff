# Program 1a 

C program to copy a file using command line arguments passed to a 
user defined function.

# Program 1b

C/C++ POSIX compliant program to check the following limits on the system:


(i) Maximum number of characters allowed in a path name


(ii) Maximum number of child processes that may be 
created 


(iii) Maximum number of characters allowed in a 
file name


(iv)Maximum number of timers that can be used simultaneously by a process


(v) Maximum number of files that can be opened simultaneously by a process


# Program 2 

C/C++ POSIX Compliant program that prints POSIX defined configuration options using feature test macros.



# Program 3

 C program that demonstrates inter-process communication between two 
processes using mkfifo, open, read, write and close APIs



# Program 4a

C program to demonstrate working of setjmp and longjmp


# Program 4b

C Program to display all the environment variables



# Program 5

C program to illustrate the race condition using parent and child 
processes.



# Program 6a

C program to imitate the mv command in Unix using link and unlink
APIs.


# Program 6b

C program to implement the System function.



 # Program 7


C/Java programs for both server and client to demonstrate interprocess communication 
using connection oriented (TCP) sockets. Client requests a file from server. The file received from 
server should be displayed on the client's terminal. Otherwise an appropriate error message should 
be printed on client side.




# Program 8

C/Java programs for both server and client to demonstrate inter-process communication 
using connectionless (UDP) sockets. Client requests a file from server. The file received from server 
should be displayed on the client's terminal. Otherwise an appropriate error message should be 
printed on client side.



# Program 9

THREE NODE POINT TO POINT NETWORK



Aim: Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.





# Program 10

TRANSMISSION OF PING MESSAGE

Aim: Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 
nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.



# Program 11


Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows : n0-n2,n1-n2 and n2-
n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP between n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over 
TCP and UDP agents. Change the parameters (e.g. Bandwith and Queue size) and determine the 
number of packets sent by TCP and UDP.



# Program 12

Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N-nodes (6-10), determine the total number of packets dropped 
due to congestion.
