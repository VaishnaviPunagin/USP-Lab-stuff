 # Program 7


C/Java programs for both server and client to demonstrate interprocess communication 
using connection oriented (TCP) sockets. Client requests a file from server. The file received from 
server should be displayed on the client's terminal. Otherwise an appropriate error message should 
be printed on client side.
